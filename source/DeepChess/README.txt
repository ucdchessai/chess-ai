HOW TO TRIAN:
-------------

0) Make sure you have `data` and `models` in your directory.
1) Make sure you hava `white(somthing).npy` and `black(something).npy` in the
    `./data/` directory.
    a) if you are training the model with 773 inputs from data extracted from
        OUR DATA SET, then use the files `blackBit.npy` and `whiteBit.npy`
    b) if you are training the model with 773 inputs from data extracted from
        data set mentioned in the paper, then use the files 
        `black_dp.npy` and `black_dp.npy`
    Datasets can be found in Google Drive:

2) Run `python3 dbn.py`
3) Run `python3 deepchess.py`
